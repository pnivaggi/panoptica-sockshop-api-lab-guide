In chapter 6 we discovered deployment policies to inject tokens into pods. Here we will focus on connection policies.

## Objectives
- Task 1. Successful Ordering
- Task 2. Apply a Connection Rule
- Task 3. Unsuccessful Ordering

## Task 1. Successful Ordering

Log into [Sock Shop](http://location.hostname:8080) with User "JohnDoe" and password "password".
Purchase some products.

You will successfully purchase your favorite socks.

## Task 2. Apply a Connection Rule

Let's block payments by blocking access to the payment service.
We can do this with a connection policy.

From the Policies sidebar, open *CONNECTION RULES*.
Select *NEW RULE*. Follow the next instructions to define the connection rule.

## Task 3. Unsuccessful Ordering

Once the policy is applied, try again to order from the [Sock Shop](http://location.hostname:8080).
If you have configured correctly the policy, you will not be able to purchase anything from this store.

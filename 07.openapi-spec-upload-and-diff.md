# 07. OpenAPI Specification Upload and Difference Detection

A reconstructed schema can be completed by increasing the data collection period or by manually injecting additional information. In this chapter, we will use pre-built schema. In a real world scenario the schema will be delivered by the developing team. Panoptica can use it to detect difference between what is expected and the real traffic. Risks are hiding in this gap among others.

## Objectives

In this section you will:

- Task 1. Upload API specifications
- Task 2. Start diffs detection
- Task 3. Analysis of diffs

## Task 1. Upload API specifications

Upload the following [spec](https://eti-demos.github.io/sockshoppayload/catalogue.json) into the catalogue API.

## Task 2. Start diffs detection

Under the **SPECS** tab you find the button to *Start diffs detection*

Choose 2 minutes.

When the 2 minutes pass, use the *Refresh* button under the **SPECS** tab.

## Task 3. Analysis of diffs

Take a look at the list of risks. In the *Tags* group we clearly see detected diffs.

The difference analysis requires context. The last image capture shows that based on the delivered spec Panoptica expects any 32-bit integer or any-format string.

However, Panoptica detects 64-bit integer and well-known string formats like UUID and json-pointer.

In this situation the spec could be completed with additional information to well capture the real, good traffic.

# 10. API Fuzzing Testing

API fuzzing tests are used to evaluate APIs for security issues. They take a few minutes to run (depending on the type of test), after which results are shown in *TEST* tab, as well as in the Security Posture tab.
You can run fuzzing tests on Internal APIs.

## Objectives

- Task 1. Upload front-end API spec
- Task 2. Start Fuzz test
- Task 3 Analyze test results

## Task 1. Upload front-end API spec

From the APIs sidebar, select *Internal APIs*.
Select front-end. Upload the following [spec](https://eti-demos.github.io/sockshoppayload/front-end.json)


## Task 2. Start Fuzz test
Switch to *RISK FINDINGS* tab.
Open *TEST*  and start a fuzz test:
* Test type - Quick Scan
* Authorization scheme - Basic Auth:
  * User name: JohnDoe
  * Password: password

## Task 3 Analyze test results

Once the test is completed, you can look for discovered vulnerabilities.

Thanks to the fuzzer we discover that the cart service is vulnerable and it's possible an internal server error to be triggered.

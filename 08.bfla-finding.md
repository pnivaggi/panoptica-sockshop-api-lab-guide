# 08. BFLA Finding

Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA) is a security vulnerability that lets unauthorized objects to access functions they should not be able to access.

Panoptica supports detection of potential BFLA issues for internal services in a Kubernetes cluster. The process consists of two phases:

1) Learning phase - observe traffic in real time and build an authorization model of service interactions.

2) Detection phase - all the API calls that do not comply with the authorization model will be marked as warnings.

You can learn more about the process [here](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity/tree/devel-global-specs/backend/pkg/modules/internal/bfla#broken-function-level-authorization-bfla).

## Objectives

- Task 1. BFLA Model Learning
- Task 2. BFLA Detection
- Task 3. BFLA Findings

## Task 1. BFLA Model Learning

The learning phase begins upon user request as soon as a user uploads or reconstructs a spec for a given API.

From the sidebar open APIs section.
From *RISK FINDING* tab, select *BFLA.
Start a 2-minute model learning.

## Task 2. BFLA Detection

Once the BFLA model is completed, we can proceed to the BFLA detection.

Let's simulate an intruder. To do this, enter the user-db pod and and call the catalogue service. user-db is not supposed to communicate with the catalogue service. Thus, it's not part of the authorization model. Execute the following commands from the command line:

```bash
USER_DB_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pod -n sock-shop -l name=user-db -o custom-columns=:metadata.name)
echo $USER_DB_POD_NAME
kubectl exec $USER_DB_POD_NAME -c user-db -n sock-shop -- sh -c 'for i in `seq 1 50`; do wget http://catalogue/catalogue; rm catalogue; sleep 3; done'
```

```console
eti-lab> USER_DB_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pod -n sock-shop -l name=user-db -o custom-columns=:metadata.name)
eti-lab> echo $USER_DB_POD_NAME
user-db-7b66877f4b-qgxr5
eti-lab> kubectl exec $USER_DB_POD_NAME -c user-db -n sock-shop -- sh -c 'for i in `seq 1 50`; do wget http://catalogue/catalogue; rm catalogue; sleep 3; done'
Connecting to catalogue (10.96.252.24:80)
saving to 'catalogue'
catalogue            100% |********************************|     3  0:00:00 ETA
'catalogue' saved
[...]
```

Start BFLA detection with a 2-minute duration:

## Task 3. BFLA Findings

At the end of the detection process you will find an alert:

user-db <-> catalogue is not part of the authorization model. Hence, the red flag.

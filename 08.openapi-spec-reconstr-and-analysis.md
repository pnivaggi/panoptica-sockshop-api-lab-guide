# 08. OpenAPI Specification Reconstruction and Risk Findings Analysis

In this section we will use Panoptica to do a static analysis of the application's APIs based on its OpenAPI specification. API specifications can be either provided by the user or reconstructed by Panoptica.

Panoptica builds schemas based on real traffic.
In a previous section we loaded an application with simulated user traffic. This will be enough for Panoptica to reconstruct big part of the application OpenAPI specification.

## Objectives

In this section you will do:

- Task 1. Analysis of Discovered Internal APIs
- Task 2. OpenAPI Specification Reconstruction
- Task 3. Read Reconstructed OpenAPI Specification
- Task 4. Risk Analysis Based on OpenAPI Schema
- Task 5. Remove reconstructed spec

## Task 1. Analysis of Discovered Internal APIs

Take a look at the discovered internal APIs.
Each micro-service uses APIs to communicate.
We will focus on only one - catalogue. The same steps can be repeated for the rest of the micro-services.

## Task 2. OpenAPI Specification Reconstruction

Open the **catalogue** micro-service from the API inventory.
In the **SPECS** tab we have two available options:

* Upload a spec
* collect data

Choose the latter.

The data collection duration depends on the user traffic bandwidth.
In our case 2 minutes is enough. Specify your cluster, too.

The data collection will last 2 minutes.

After the data collection, you can review the reconstructed spec.

Two endpoints are discovered:

* /catalogue/{param1}
* /catalogue

Check both and approve.

Specify the latest OAS version - V3.

After the review approval, Panoptica builds an OpenAPI schema.

## Task 3. Read Reconstructed OpenAPI Specification

After the spec build, you can always analyze the swagger file.
Under the **specs** tab, you will find an option to **See on swagger**.

The Swagger will open in a separate page.

## Task 4. Risk Analysis Based on OpenAPI Schema

Once the **catalogue** API schema is available, Panoptica automatically analyzes it. The results are available in the UI.

Under the **risk findings** you will find a new group called **api-specification**. Any schema-related risks are listed here.
Take a look at the findings. Some require actions, others are related to the fact that the reconstructed schema is light.

## Task 5. Remove reconstructed spec

From the **SPECS** tab, click Reset. This is wipe the reconstructed spec and give the possibility to upload a new one.

# 11. API Trace Analysis

Trace Analysis shows security findings resulting from an analysis of actual API traffic, compared with an API spec. These findings can be, for example, weak passwords, bad IDs, potential BOLA, etc.
In order to run trace analyses, you must upload an API spec (see API Spec analysis), and enable trace analysis in the cluster.

## Objectives

- Task 1. Start Trace Analysis
- Task 2. Trace Analysis Results

## Task 1. Start Trace Analysis

From the APIs sidebar, select *Internal APIs*.
